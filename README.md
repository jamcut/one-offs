One-Offs
========

A place to store quick an dirty things that I have used previously.  Not super useful every day, but I dont want to forget them.

1. [hashwords.py](https://github.com/jamcut/one-offs/blob/master/hashwords.py) - For when the hash is the password.
2. [combine.py](https://github.com/jamcut/one-offs/blob/master/combine.py) - Used to strip usernames out of one file and passwords from another and match them back up based on the password hash.
3. [notes-extract.py](https://github.com/jamcut/one-offs/blob/master/notes-xtract.py) - Used to pull Lotus Notes names and hashes out of saved responses from Burp Intruder.
