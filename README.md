One-Offs
========

A place to store quick an dirty things that I have used previously.  Not super useful every day, but I dont want to forget them.

1. [hashwords.py](https://github.com/jamcut/one-offs/blob/master/hashwords.py) - For when the hash is the password.
2. [combine.py](https://github.com/jamcut/one-offs/blob/master/combine.py) - Used to strip usernames out of one file and passwords from another and match them back up based on the password hash.
3. [notes-xtract.py](https://github.com/jamcut/one-offs/blob/master/notes-xtract.py) - Used to pull Lotus Notes names and hashes out of saved responses from Burp Intruder.
4. [pyip.py](https://github.com/jamcut/one-offs/blob/master/pyip.py) - A better way to get the IP address than parsing the output of ifconfig.  Not my code, found on stack overflow somewhere and didn't want to lose it.
5. [Enumerate-TrustedDocuments.ps1](https://github.com/jamcut/one-offs/blob/master/Enumerate-TrustedDocuments.ps1) - Enumerate trusted locations and documents for MS Excel from registry.
